# AI-ML Portfolio 🚀

This repository showcases my **hands-on learning journey in AI/ML**, applying core concepts of **data science, machine learning, and deep learning** to real-world datasets.  
Most projects use **open datasets from [IndiaAI Kosh](https://aikosh.indiaai.gov.in/)**, with some additional public datasets where relevant.  

The goal:  
- Build practical experience in AI/ML, beyond theory  
- Share reproducible notebooks for public learning  
- Establish thought leadership with **IndiaAI blogposts** based on these projects

## 📂 Repository Structure


Each subfolder contains:  
- `notebook.ipynb` → runnable code in Google Colab  
- `README.md` (optional) → short project summary  
- link to dataset (instead of uploading heavy CSVs)

## ⚒️ Tools & Frameworks

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch for some experiments)  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- Google Colab for development  
- GitHub Copilot for faster coding
